  <p>
    The privacy policy is simple: we don't store any of your personal data.
    This app will request that you log in using Google and choose a .buckets file.
    This is only so we can display your budget info to you.
    We don't store or send this data to any servers.
    A copy of some of the data will be stored only in your own browser's local storage.
